    Comments in JavaScript
JavaScript supports both C-style and C++-style comments. Thus:
Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and
is ignored by JavaScript.
1. Any text between the characters /* and */ is treated as a comment. This
may span multiple lines.
2. JavaScript also recognizes the HTML comment opening sequence <!--.
JavaScript treats this as a single-line comment, just as it does the //
comment.
3. The HTML comment closing sequence --> is not recognized by JavaScript
so it should be written as //-->.
